Microsoft AZURE has emerged as a very strong cloud competitor in this fast emerging field and is here to stay. With all the professional software offerings and 
industry leading integrations of dominant softwares and providers, Azure is going to be very big. I started with my Azure introduction around a year back in Oct 2019.

Microsoft has aligned their certifications around roles which is more logical way in today's environment. You can target your role and study that path to become one in terms
of raw knowledge. If you have a working project it's best but if not no need to get disappointed this is still a new field and everyone is learning, just do the labs and exercises.
Azure Solutions Architect Expert is one of the most sought after certifications and not an easy one to achieve.

Take a look at full MS Azure Certification board here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/

Azure Solutions Architect Expert requires you to you pass three exams:
1. Azure Fundamentals
2. AZ- 303
3. AZ- 304

Ref:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/roles/solutions-architect

AZ 303 is new exam version from Oct 1st 2020 which was AZ- 300 and similarly AZ 304 is what was AZ- 301.
So if you have passed any one exam AZ-300 or AZ-301 you can just give one more newer version of exam and get the Azure Solutions Architect Expert badge.

The sallybus for AZ-303 and AZ-304 is on the certification dashboard when you navigate towards a particular exam. Each topic has been mentioned and you are expected to
understand as well as have hands on for them as there would be lab exercises in the exam.

The two exams are quite lengthy each having a duration of around 3 hours. The questions may be just 45-50 in count but the length and content is heavy and will require you to think.
The options are meant to be confusing and there could be more than one solution.

Resources:

Create a personal Azure subscription if you already don't have one as you will need on even if you have a corparate Azure account as the coursework requires hands on with a lot
of Azure Active Directory and it's services which users usually don't have in corporate environment.

To begin with basics I completed the following courses on Udemy with all the exeercises being done independently by me.

UDEMY COURSEWORK and EXAMS:
Scott Duffy's AZ - 300/303 course and AZ - 301/304 course complete with all modules and practice tests and labs.

Microsoft's own learning portal is best. It gives you Azure sandbox environment almost for whole day and your daily quota get's refreshed each day :)
